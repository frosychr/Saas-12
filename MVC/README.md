# :gear: **MVC Architecture**

MVC Web App: https://mvc-askmeanything.herokuapp.com/

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.

Each architecture component is built to handle specific development aspect of an application.

In this web app the controller communicates with the model and the view.
